									<p>My journey into the world of technology began in Takoradi, Ghana, where I grew up with a deep-seated curiosity for gadgets and innovation. From a young age, I was captivated by how things worked and was determined to explore the endless possibilities of technology. This early fascination laid the foundation for an impressive journey marked by academic excellence, athletic achievement, and professional growth.</p>
									<p>I attended Aggrey Memorial Senior High School, where my aptitude for science and mathematics shone brightly. Excelling in my studies, I developed a keen interest in computer science, spending countless hours learning to code and building small projects. My dedication to learning earned me top grades and the admiration of my teachers and peers.
										In addition to my academic pursuits, I was an avid swimmer. Competing at the national level, I honed my discipline, teamwork, and resilienceâ€”qualities that would later become invaluable in my academic and professional endeavors.</p>
